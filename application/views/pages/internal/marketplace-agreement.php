<h5>1.  The Adap.tv Marketplace.</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.1	Adap.tv offers a marketplace for advertisements, and related software and services (collectively, the <strong>"Marketplace"</strong>) through which publishers of video content (<strong>"Publishers"</strong>) may specify one or more uniquely defined, named and described advertising opportunities (<strong>"Placements"</strong>) and make each such opportunity available for advertisers and advertising agencies (<strong>"Advertisers"</strong>) to purchase Placements for display of their advertisements (<strong>"Market Ad(s)"</strong>). Advertisers specify the parameters that define which Placements to target for delivering such Market Ads ("Ad Targeting"), as well as the maximum amount they are willing to pay (the <strong>"Bid"</strong>) for display of the Market Ads (which may be presented to Publishers in the form of an insertion order or <strong>"IO"</strong>). Publishers specify the parameters that define which ads may be shown in each Placement (<strong>"Placement Restriction(s)"</strong>), as well as the minimum Market Price (defined below) they are willing to accept for ads in their Placement (<strong>"Reserve Price"</strong>). The Marketplace provides Advertisers with descriptions of Placements for Advertisers to preview and approve (<strong>"Placement Description(s)"</strong>), and provides Publishers with Market Ad campaigns for Publishers to preview and approve (manually or automatically).</li>
                    <li>1.2 For each ad opportunity associated with a particular Placement, the Marketplace determines a set of Market Ad campaigns that match the Placement according to the Ad Targeting and Placement Restrictions (the <strong>"Matching Ad(s)"</strong>). The Marketplace then uses an auction mechanism to select a particular Market Ad to display (the <strong>"Winning Ad"</strong>) and to determine the price (the <strong>"Market Price"</strong>) for displaying the Market Ad. The auction mechanism takes into consideration the winning Bid, the Bids of the other Matching Ads, and the Reserve Price set by the Publisher. The Market Price will never be greater than the winning Bid or less than the Reserve Price. </li>
                    

                </ul>
            
<h5>2.  Registration.</h5>
                <ul>

You are responsible for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions, and you must promptly notify Adap.tv of any unauthorized use of your Account. Account registration is subject to Adap.tv's prior approval and your compliance with the Agreement. Adap.tv reserves the right to refuse registration for any reason.

                <ul>
                <li>7.1	As an Advertiser in the Marketplace, you will pay Adap.tv the Market Price for each and every time Adap.tv displays your Market Ads in Placements to human users as counted by Adap.tv using a methodology substantially similar to industry standards.

                    <li>7.2	For each full or partial calendar month in which this Agreement is in effect, you will pay Adap.tv the greater of (i) the Monthly Spend or (ii) ten thousand dollars ($10,000) within thirty (30) days after the end of the applicable calendar month. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars. Payments are calculated solely based on records maintained by Adap.tv. You will pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Marketplace.</li>
                    <li>7.3	If you dispute any payment made in connection with the Marketplace, you must notify Adap.tv in writing within thirty (30) days of any such payment. Failure to so notify Adap.tv will result in your waiver of any claims related to such disputed payment. If you fail to pay Adap.tv on time, Adap.tv may suspend delivery of your Market Ads until your account is made current, including payment of late fees at the lesser of (i) 1% per month, or (ii) the maximum rate allowed by law.</li>
                   
                </ul>

                <li>8.1	As a Publisher in the Marketplace, Adap.tv will pay you at least your Reserve Price, and often more depending on the market, for each and every time Adap.tv displays a Market Ad in your Placements to human users as counted by Adap.tv using a methodology substantially similar to industry standards. For each calendar month in which Market Ads are displayed on your Placements, Adap.tv will aggregate the amounts due you from the associated payments received from Advertisers (the <strong>"Monthly Revenue"</strong>), and calculate and report any Monthly Revenue to you after the end of such calendar month, and will pay you the Monthly Revenue within sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable calendar month.</li>   
                <li>8.2	All payments will be made in U.S. dollars. Adap.tv may make payments only when an outstanding balance exceeds US $50.00 (or until termination of your Account).

                <li>8.3	Adap.tv reserves the right to withhold payment if you (i) breach the Agreement, or (ii) engage in any deceptive or fraudulent activity, including, without limitation, clicks without referring URLs, extraordinarily high numbers of repeat clicks, fraudulent impressions generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device, or any clicks from non-approved root URLs (as determined by Adap.tv in its sole discretion). Adap.tv will not, however, withhold payment with respect to unaffected IOs (regarding which Adap.tv is comfortable you have not breached the Agreement or engaged in deceptive or otherwise inappropriate conduct), notwithstanding any ongoing concern regarding a separate affected IO, as long as Adap.tv itself has received full payment for the unaffected IO and the relevant Advertiser has not raised a concern about deceptive/inappropriate conduct regarding the unaffected IOs.</li>            
                <li>8.4	Adap.tv assumes no responsibility for paying income taxes on behalf of Publisher.
