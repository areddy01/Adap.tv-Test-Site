			<p>Adap.tv respects your right to online privacy. You can read Adap.tv's privacy policy <a class="OverlayLink" href="<?=site_url('privacy')?>">here</a></p>

<p>Adap.tv provides a wide range of advertising technologies to advertisers and publishers, including the ability to target advertisements to viewers based on their interests and past online behavior using browser cookies. If you would prefer not to receive browser cookies from Adap.tv for the purpose of targeting advertisements, you can choose to opt out by clicking the button below. If you have already opted out, the current status will say "Opt-Out Cookie".</p>

<p><div id="OptoutImage"><img src="http://optout.adap.tv/optout/status?nocache=0.3184015" id="optoutimg" /></div>
<a href="javascript:optout();" id="OptoutButton"></a>
<div class="clear"></div></p>

<p>Once you have opted out of cookie-based targeting you will no longer receive cookies from Adap.tv for the purpose of targeting advertisements, and you will no longer receive ads that are tailored to your particular interests.</p>

<p>The Adap.tv opt-out button works by replacing existing targeting cookies from Adap.tv with a new cookie that indicates that the user has opted out of cookie-based targeting. If you delete the opt-out cookie, buy a new computer, or change your Web browser, you will have to repeat the opt-out process. Note that the opt-out does not mean that you will no longer receive ads or cookies from Adap.tv; Adap.tv may still display ads that do not use cookie-based targeting, and may still set basic cookies to ensure proper ad delivery (e.g., to make sure you do not see the same ad too frequently).</p>
