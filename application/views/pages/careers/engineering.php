    <h2>We’re revolutionizing the video and TV advertising industry one line of code at a time.</h2>
	<h3>So every line counts, including yours.</h3>
    <p>There isn’t a company in Silicon Valley that isn’t talking about innovation, or revolution, or staying nimble. But with us, it’s actually true. We’re radically changing the way our industry buys and sells video and TV advertising and we’re growing fast. How fast? We’re the second fastest growing Bay Area company in the Inc. 500. In fact, by the time you finish reading this, we’ve probably deployed something new. With us, what you engineer today goes live tomorrow. That’s why we need creative minds who think big. Order-takers and robots need not apply.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>
    		<h6>Freedom to innovate and create.</h6>
    		<p>We deliberately empower engineers by pushing out multiple deployments every day. That means you’ll actually see the results of your work. And not in some dreamy, theoretical way on a white board.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>We’ll know you by name, not your cube number.</h6>
            <p>We’re a tight team that does more work than it does talking about it. We guarantee you rapid feedback and peer code reviews. Your career with us will grow faster and go further in less time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>You’ll work with other really smart people.</h6>
            <p>(Including a few who are smarter than you.) You’ll work side by side and learn from some of the best minds in the industry. We hire from MIT, Berkeley and Stanford, just to name a few.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>You’ll solve interesting problems and develop interesting technology.</h6>
            <p>And you’ll do it fast. Two-week agile sprints are for wimps.  We release new code over 10 times per day with our innovative continuous deployment approach. Our system processes 8 TB of data (2 billion events) per day, and turns it into actionable insights. We’ve come a long way, but there’s so much more to be invented and you can a part of that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>This is an unprecedented time to join A big, new, rapidly growing industry.</h6>
            <p>The online video advertising market is already $3.5 billion in the US, and the broader TV advertising market is $70 billion. But in case you haven't noticed, these two worlds are merging. People are shifting in large numbers from watching cable to video on the web. Much of that video is ad-supported, so the advertising needs to follow the viewers. The traditional TV advertising industry has to adopt a completely new technology stack to enable advertising in digital video. That’s where we come in. Adap.tv is the leading innovator of that technology stack. And that’s why we’re the most widely used video ad platform in the US. Our products are used by 14 out of the 15 top advertising agencies, and 48 out of the top 50 brand spenders. There’s never been a better time than now to become a part of an exciting new market.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>Yes, we have all the same benefits as the big boys.</h6>
            	<ul class="checkmarks">
                	<li>Stock options? Check. You’ll have equity on the ground floor of a growing company.</li>
                    <li>Generous paid time off. Maintain a good work-life balance. Yes, really we mean that.</li>
                    <li>Fully catered lunches available everyday to all employees at the corporate office.</li>
                    <li>Offices fully loaded with snacks and drinks.</li>
                    <li>Extensive employee benefits and perks to show how much we value your effort.</li>
                    <li>Team events, company events, employee sponsored events, employee recognition awards, and more.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h6>We’re not run by jerks.</h6>
            <p>Our CEO and co-founder are engineers. They’re also nice guys. We’re an engineering company at heart, and we truly believe in having a strong collaborative engineering culture. We give you a guiding hand when you need it, and the freedom to do what you do when you don’t.</p>
        </li>
   </ul>
   
   <h5>So what do we want from you?</h5>

		<img src="<?=site_url('/styles/images/careers/engineering_chess.jpg')?>" border="0" />
    </div>   
   <p>We want creative thinkers, independent spirits, and people with an open mind. We want engineers who are excited by building innovative technology in a supportive, team environment. We want programmers that are not tied to any one language and willing to learn some new ones. Your length of experience is less important than your openness to take on new experiences.</p>
