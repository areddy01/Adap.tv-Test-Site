<h3><!-- 4:45 - 5:05pm<br/>  -->The Future: Internet Pioneers as Marketers </h3>
<p><!--
According to media ecologist, Jack Myers, the single greatest threat to the traditional advertising business will be a failure to attract Internet Pioneers into the ad business. In his new book, Hooked Up: A New Generation's Surprising Take on Sex, Politics and Saving the World, Myers introduces a new and previously unrecognized generation - the first to grow up with the Internet as an embedded part of their lives. Hear what new innovative tactics that truly exploit the potential of the Internet will evolve as these Internet Pioneers gain control over the marketing of major corporations, ad agencies and media companies - tactics that will move the ad business as we know it today, in an entirely different direction.
